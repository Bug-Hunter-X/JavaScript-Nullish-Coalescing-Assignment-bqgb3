# JavaScript Nullish Coalescing Assignment Bug

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in JavaScript related to nullish coalescing assignment. The `foo` function aims to add two numbers, but its handling of `null` values may lead to unexpected behavior.

## Bug Description

The issue lies in the function's direct comparison (`===`) with `null`. While this works for explicitly passed `null` values, it can cause unexpected results if the function is used within a larger application where the input parameters could potentially be `undefined`, leading to type errors or incorrect calculations.

## Solution

The provided solution improves null handling using nullish coalescing to provide default values and ensure the function's robustness when dealing with variables potentially containing either `null` or `undefined` values.
